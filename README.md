Repository for Juno College Cohort 36 Project 1

This is a 3 page HTML/CSS conversion of a PSD design for Juno College Summer Bootcamp 2021 Cohort 36. The site is responsive with media queries at 480px 768px and 940px and includes a mobile version with hamburger menu. All assets and design specs were provdided by Juno College, but the mobile layout is my own take on the desktop design I was probvided by Juno. The project includes a live environment on Git Hub Pages, implementation of SASS partials, mixins, and variables. The project was completed in about 20hrs spread over a week. 
 

********** Hey David, I left a note in the media query 768 partial about wanting to add a VISIBLE focus effect to a hidden checkbox label
that I was unable to figure out even with Help Cue assistance and a BUNCH of googling. **********

 Please enjoy the project!
